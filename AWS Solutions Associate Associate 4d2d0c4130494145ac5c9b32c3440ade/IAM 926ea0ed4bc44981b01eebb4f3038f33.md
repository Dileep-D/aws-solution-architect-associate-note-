# IAM 101

Allows to manage users, groups, policies, roles ...

IAM offers the following feature

- Centralised controls of AWS account
- Shared Access
- Granular Permissions
- Identity Federation (AD, GSuite, ...)
- Multifactor Authentication
- Provide temporary access for users/devices and services where nessary
- Allows to set up password rotation policy
- Integrates with many different AWS services
- Supports PCI DSS Compliance

- IAM is universal, any activity is on Global region, not any specific region.
- The "root account" is simply the account created when first setup AWS account, it has complete Admin access
- New Users have NO permissions when first created
- New Users are assigned Access Key ID & Secret Access Keys when first created
- These are not the same as password. Cannot user Access Key ID & Secret Access Key to login to console, we can use this to access AWS via the APIs and Command Line, however (programmatic access)
- View these once. If lose them we have to regenerate
- Always setup Multifactor Authentication on root account.
- Can create and customise password rotation policies

Create group and select the policies to be attached to the group.
