# Courses

[AWS Certified Solutions Architect: Associate Certification Exam](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate/)

AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate 2020

This course is 15 hours video course. I learn every day for 1 hour and I finish this course in about 2 weeks. The above notes are extracted from this course.

Learn tons of useful stuff, not any lesson longer than 30 minutes, comes with hands-on in AWS as well. Actually some lectures actually a bit boring tho.

[AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Practice Exams](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-amazon-practice-exams-saa-c02)

After you learn all the basics, if you sit for an exam right away, chances are that you gonna fail.

This course has 6 practice tests. After each test, you have very detailed explanations, external resources, which area knowledge you need to improve.

Each test is 150 minutes, I do it and review all the questions for 1 week, 1 hour every day. So the total for 6 tests is 1.5 months.

Do all practices test and I'm pretty sure that you can ACE the real exam for 900+ pts!
